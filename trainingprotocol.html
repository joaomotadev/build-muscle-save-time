    <p><h2>MODIFIED MYO REPS PROTOCOL (MY APPROACH)</h2>
    <h3>SOURCES:</h3>
    <div>
        <a href="https://www.borgefagerli.com/myo-reps-in-english">You can find the original protocol here</a>
    </div>
    <h3>#Warming up</h3>
    <h4>Do you really need to warm-up?</h4>
    <p>If <strong>YOU FEEL</strong> that <strong>WARM-UP SETS</strong> aren't required to execute that exercise safely, then jump straight into the working load, do your <strong>WORKING SET + MYOREPS</strong></p>
    <p>I only apply this when it comes to isolation/machines/cables/just your bodyweight (no added weight) exercises.</p>
    <h4>For bigger and heavier compound movements, I like to WARM-UP like this:</h4>
    <p>Example: Last workout, Smith Machine Bench Press, 8 REPS, 60KG (workload)</p>
    <p> 1 WARM-UP SET: 50% workload (30kg), 8 REPS </p>
    <p> 2 WARM-UP SET: 75% workload (45kg), 4 REPS </p>    
    <p> 3 WARM-UP SET: 100% Workload (60kg), 2 REPS </p> 
    <p><strong>REST; START WORKING SET + MYO REPS</strong></p>
    <h3>"What about the rest times between the WARM-UP sets?"<em></em></h3>
    <p>Rest as long as you need! The goal isn't to fatigue you, it's to make you <strong>READY</strong> for the heavy work!</p>
    <h3>#Work Set + Myoreps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>After the WARM-UP SETS (if needed), use your WORKLOAD to perform the set until or very close to failure 
            <p>*(remember, safety is your N1 priority, if you can't fail safely, just stay 1 rep away (1RIR) from failure)</p></li>
        
        <li>Take 3-5 deep breaths, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth</li>
        <p></p>
        <li><strong>Do 3 mini-sets!</strong>
            <p>The total of reps performed on the three mini-sets should be equal to the number of reps perfomed on the first <strong>WORKSET</strong></p> 
            <p>Between each mini-set, take 3-5 deep breaths</p></li>
        <li><STRONG>PRATICAL EXAMPLE</STRONG>
            <p><strong>Smith Machine Bench Press:</strong></p>
            <p>8 reps workset / 3 deep breaths / 3 reps / 3 deep breaths / 3 reps </p>
            <p>/ 3 deep breaths / 2 reps <strong>(MYOREPS END HERE)</strong></p>
            <p>If you do some quick math, you can see that the number of reps you did on the "mini-sets" it's equal to your workset rep number <strong>(8 reps workset / 3+3+2 myo reps)</strong></p>
        </li>
        </ol>
    <h3>#How long should I rest?</h3>
    <p>As you can see, you only finish your "set" when the MYOREPS are done and after that, you can move to a different exercise.</p>
    <p>How long should you rest between exercises?</p>
    <p>If you just did a <strong>HEAVY COMPOUND EXERCISE</strong>, rest between 2-5 mins</p>
    <p> If it was <strong>a isolation/machine/cable/bodyweight only</strong>, rest between 1-3 mins</p>
    <h3>#AVOID THESE EXERCISES FOR THE MYOREPS PROTOCOL</h3>
    <p><strong>Criteria for NOT DOING a specific exercise with this approach</strong></p>
    <p>1) it's not save to fail on the exercise</p>
    <p> 2) failing on the exercise will leave you feeling completely destroyed</p>
    <p> <strong>Some exercises that (might) fit this criteria:</strong></p>
    <p> Deadlifts + other heavy variations</p>
    <p> BB Squats + other heavy variations</p>
    <p> BB Bench Press</p>
    <p><strong>*BB means barbell</strong></p>
